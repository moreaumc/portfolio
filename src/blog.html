        <h3>Pressing the Wrong Button</h3>
        <div class="c-blog__body">
          <p>On January 13th, 2018, a false alarm went out in Hawaii stating a missile strike was imminent. A lot of articles were written about how good design could have stopped what was, at the time, believed to be a mistake. I felt like a lot of the writing took a "design is good" tone, but were far too generic and consumer-focused. I wanted to add a perspective from someone who worked in the industrial space on critical systems where preventing errors is often more important than making interfaces easy-to-use. My article was published under the GE Design publication on Medium.</p>

        <div class="c-blog__body">
          <p><span class="o-emphasis">UPDATE:</span> It has since come out that the operator genuinely thought that the missile strike was real, making the article a little out of date. Making sure a user does not act on bad information is still an important aspect of good design, but it's a whole nother article in-and-of itself.</p>
