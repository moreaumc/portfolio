          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>Historically, GE Digital has had a problem with telling a compelling story about how the Predix platform works to drive business outcomes. There are lots of architectural diagrams, and product feature lists that say WHAT it does, but there isn't a holistic view which shows WHY someone should use it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="c-piece__text">
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>The Data Journey diagram answers that question and does it in a simple, easy-to-consume fashion. The Director of Cloud Engineering is using it as a central part of his communication strategy, recently presented it to 400 CIOs in Florence, Italy, and keeps a copy at his desk. A Sr. Director of Product Management included it in a strategy presentation to the GE Digital Customer Advisory Board, and the CEO of GE Digital described it as “the best view of Predix” he had ever seen.</p>

        <div class="c-piece__text">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>The Data Journey is a hand-drawn diagram that represents how data generated by large, industrial assets is securely transferred to the cloud, processed, analyzed and used by customers to improve the performance of their fleet, all utilizing the various products and capabilities offered by Predix.</p>
          <p>It intentionally does not contain a lot of explanatory text as it is meant to be part of a presentation or, even better, a discussion. The emphasis is not on the individual items but on the connections and relationships between them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="c-piece__text">
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>Last year, I was asked to explain how several projects I had worked on fit together. So I sat down with a pencil and a piece of paper and started sketching out a diagram. I brought my sketches around to various stakeholders to get validation and feedback. It resonated with a lot of people and I was often asked for a copy. Eventually, it evolved from a series of connected products to a representation of how data moves through Predix: this was the data journey.</p>

          <p>The diagram is also the basis for an interactive prototype. Each section is a clickable hotspot that gives the viewer a more detailed description of what it does and how it works with other capabilities. The detail pages only have one or two sentences with a single, supporting image. These pages can then be linked to technical literature, use cases, or even a high-fidelity prototype of a specific tool, letting the viewer go as deep into the feature as they want.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>Our initial research consisted of studying best practices through papers and tutorials from industry experts, conducting interviews with 14 specialists, and running workshops with three development teams with a variety of maturity in their practices.</p>
            <p>To synthesize our research, we used affinity diagramming and AEIOU techniques. We developed four personas, and created a set of design principles to inform our solution. In order to demonstrate how our principles could be expressed within the product, we drew storyboards.</p>

          <p>Then, we sketched out designs and built an interactive prototype which we used to conduct usability testing. The testing went well but it also exposed some problems with how information was displayed. Users were confused by the simplified, abstract view of the pipeline (shown on the left) so we iterated on the pipeline summary, adding more information, and re-tested with greater success.</p>

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>The Predix Console is a set of tools to help software development teams manage SaaS applications, but it had a problem. The information architecture reflected the underlying technical structure of the system, not the mental model of a software developer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="c-piece__text">
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>After some determined campaigning, I was able to convince the other designers and the development team that we needed to fundamentally change the structure of the Console. A new version with an improved layout was released at the end of 2017.</p>

            <p>Applications are deployed to the Predix Platform in spaces. The original console forced a user to select a space first, to see what was deployed in it. However, that's not how developers use the spaces. A single app is deployed to multiple spaces in order to test it before releasing to production.</p>
            <p>The new Console flips this paradigm and lets a user select an app first, showing the spaces where it is deployed in a list on the left-hand side. Selecting a space shows the details for that instance. This allows a user to have a holistic view of an application as code changes are made and it moves through the deployment pipeline, while still retaining granular control over usage and billing on a per space level.</p>

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>I had long been an advocate for fundamentally changing the way information was structured in the Console, especially how the relationship between different elements was represented. When I proposed changing the structure, I was met with a considerable amount of reluctance and debate, not just from the development team but other designers, too. The concern was that it would be a significant effort to change the structure and would require a considerable amount of redesign on how a user moved around the Console.</p>

        <div class="c-piece__story o-layout">
          <div class="o-layout__item c-piece__story">
            <p>In order to show the value of what I was proposing, I drew up site maps and workflow diagrams to show how a user would need to go to multiple locations to get the information they needed. I also conducted a wayfinding exercise to show how getting around the Console was confusing due to the fact it forced a user into an overly narrow view of their apps. Eventually, I was able to convince the team that this was better information architecture and that the additional effort needed to implement it was worthwhile.</p>

        <h2 class="c-piece__title">Culture Change</h2>
        <div class="c-piece__text">
          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>When working with a team that does not have an established design process, it can be difficult to integrate as a designer. A principal designer I worked with put it simply as:</p>
          <div class="c-callout">Design is easy:<br />it's building relationships that's hard.</div>
          <p>Making the case for the value of UX only goes so far. Often it is like a person who knows they need to lose weight but doesn’t know how to begin; without actionable steps to take, nothing will change. To that end, I created the UX Working Agreement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="c-piece__text">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>The UX Working Agreement was born out of researching different ways people had integrated good design practices into the Agile/Lean software development process. It outlines four concrete deliverables that I, as an interaction designer, will provide to the team. It also shows what I need to accomplish those and the risks if I don’t get that support. It’s couched in the language of Agile practices, such as dependencies and blockers, and takes a positive tone; it’s not about demanding that a team work with me, but about showing them the tangible benefit if they do.</p>
          <p>The agreement was designed in a tabloid size so that it could be printed out and hung up like a poster in the working area. That way, it could be referenced at any time, such as during standups.</p>
